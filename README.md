## About this Repo

This project is **now open sourced and completely free**. Hope you enjoy it!

If you like it, please consider [sponsor](#-support-this-project) this project.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently focused on SD1.5 and SDXL models. SD2.1 is no longer maintained due to poor quality and limited popularity.
>
> **NPU support:**
>
> - SD1.5 models are supported on Snapdragon NPUs with Hexagon V68 architecture or newer.
> - SDXL models are supported on Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and newer devices.
>
> CPU/GPU inference supports SD1.5 and imported SDXL MNN packages. Large SDXL
> models require substantially more memory than SD1.5.
>
> You can join our [telegram group](https://t.me/local_dream) for discussion or help with testing.


## GPU backend behavior

For MNN-backed CPU models, the GPU option now selects the best available mobile GPU
backend in this order:

1. **Vulkan** — preferred when the Android device exposes a working Vulkan driver.
2. **OpenCL** — compatibility fallback for devices whose Vulkan session cannot be created.
3. **CPU** — final fallback, so GPU selection does not make unsupported devices unusable.

The MNN Android build enables both `MNN_VULKAN` and `MNN_OPENCL`. MNN loads the
device graphics drivers at runtime; the app does not bundle a generic Vulkan driver.
The existing GPU toggle and saved `use_opencl` request field remain compatible.

This path accelerates the MNN-backed SD1.5 CPU pipeline and imported SDXL MNN
packages. Snapdragon QNN/NPU models and the separate DiT engine keep their own
runtimes; selecting this GPU option does not redirect those engines.
